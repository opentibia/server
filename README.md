# What is this?

OTServ is a free MMORPG emulation, that creates a own gameworld server,
based on the CIPSoft's Tibia.

This version of OpenTibia is based on the revscriptsys branch of OTServ,
and is as such NOT backwards-compatible with old distributions like TFS or
OTServ 0.6.3. This has been done to greatly enhance the scripting system,
moving to a much more flexible and dynamic system that allows much more
control.

# How does it work?

This version of OTServ is targeted towards Tibia 8.7.

To connect Tibia client to OTServ you will have to use an IP changer, you can get one here
http://www.otchanger.net/

Once that's done, start the OTServ up, quite simple, just execute otserv.exe by
double clicking it.

You have to execute some sql queries from schema.mysql, schema.pgsql or even schema.sqlite.
And check it out. Once you are done, have a look around in the folders
and take a look at the config.lua

NEVER ever enter your real acc# and/or password when not connecting to the CIP servers.
Then you are logged in.
