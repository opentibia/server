# Open Tibia Server [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/opentibia/server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/opentibia/server)

OTServ is a free MMORPG emulation, that creates a own gameworld server,
based on the CIPSoft's Tibia.

This version of OpenTibia is based on the revscriptsys branch of OTServ,
and is as such NOT backwards-compatible with old distributions like TFS or
OTServ 0.6.3. This has been done to greatly enhance the scripting system,
moving to a much more flexible and dynamic system that allows much more
control.

# Looking for developers

Open Tibia is currently looking for developers. If you want to become one, please send an email to iryont@gmail.com

# How does it work?

This version of OTServ is targeted towards Tibia 8.7.

You have to execute some sql queries from schema.mysql, schema.pgsql or even schema.sqlite.
And check it out. Once you are done, have a look around in the folders
and take a look at the config.lua

NEVER ever enter your real acc# and/or password when not connecting to the CIP servers.
Then you are logged in.

# Fast compiler with Linux

If your desktop is based on linux, do not cry, install the docker and then run the following command:
```
docker run -ti --rm=true -v $(pwd):/opentibia/server opentibia/compiler-server
```

success! You compiled this project in a few minutes. :muscle:

OK! But now, how I can run? Very simple, this command is your solution:

```
docker run -ti --rm=true -v $(pwd):/opentibia/server -p 7171:7171 -p 7172:7172 opentibia/run-server
```
