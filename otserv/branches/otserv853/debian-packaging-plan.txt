Just a few notes on what's necessary to do, compiled by ivucica
Anyone can contribute :)

Some of these things will generally benefit otserv, some will benefit 
Debian and Ubuntu users...


* daemonize
  - server should fork off right away after startup
  - server should write its pidfile somewhere in /var to allow detection and
    killing of running server
  - server should implement a command line option "-k" which will find
    server's pid and kill the process
  - functionality easy to implement using debian's libdaemon (google it up!)

* add init.d
  - use /etc/init.d/skeleton as basis for an init.d script
  - use dh_installinit to install the symlinks to the script into proper 
    places in rcX.d
  
* when installing create user 'otserv'; from init.d, run server under that user
  - should be done in preinst script
  - check out /var/lib/dpkg/info/mysql-server-5.0.preinst
  - don't forget to remove the user upon uninstallation of the program
  - Evgeni from debian-devel-games: "setuid wont work on scripts. better use 
    su or start-stop-servers --chuid or --user ;)"

* optional: database configuration using debconf
  - many debian packages (e.g. roundcube) use debconf scripts for prompting
    user to input configuration data through a gui
  - using this allows both terminal users and gui users to get configuration
    ui in their environment-specific "friendly" manner
  - roundcube mentions db-config, someone should study this -- help and
    suggestions welcome
